            I'm a 20 years old Computer Engineering student in ITU.
            I've always had a passion for video games and began my own journey as a Junior Developer in 2021.
            Since then, I've worked hard to improve myself.
            I participated in a number of game jams and developed games in under 48 hours both working solo and within a team.
            As the Event Team Manager for the ITU Game Design And Development Club, I organized two game jams.
            I had the opportunity to work as a Developer Intern at an Istanbul-based gaming studio and gain firsthand knowledge of how a professional studio operates.
            I'm currently working as a Project Manager, Game Designer, and primarily Programmer on a personal project.
